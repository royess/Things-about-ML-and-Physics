1. Unsupervised Generative Modeling Using Matrix Product States (Zhao-Yu Han, Jun Wang, Heng Fan, Lei Wang, Pan Zhang)

> Inspired by probabilistic
interpretation of quantum physics, we propose a generative model using matrix product states, which is a
tensor network originally proposed for describing (particularly one-dimensional) entangled quantum states.
Our model enjoys efficient learning analogous to the density matrix renormalization group method, which
allows dynamically adjusting dimensions of the tensors and offers an efficient direct sampling approach for
generative tasks.  

> Our work sheds light on many interesting
directions of future exploration in the development of quantum-inspired algorithms for unsupervised
machine learning, which are promisingly possible to realize on quantum devices.
